        <p>
            The contents of our pages have been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws pursuant to § 7 para. 1 DDG (German Digital Services Act). According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, however, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which we become aware of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such legal violations, we will remove this content immediately.

            Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this third-party content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
